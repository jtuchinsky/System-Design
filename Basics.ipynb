    "\n",
    "**\"Correctness\"** - definition was coined by Leslie Lamport in “Proving the Correctness of Multiprocess Programs” (https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/proving.pdf). Lamport defines the correctness of a system in terms of its safety and liveness properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety.** Informally, a safety property guarantees that something bad will never happen.\n",
    "- **Liveness.** Informally, a liveness property guarantees that something good will eventually happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "A system is correct if every possible behavior of the system is correct, that is, if every possible behavior meets the system's safety and liveness guarantees"

    "\n",
    "__Responsiveness__\n",
    "\n",
    "- _**Responsiveness**_ is formally defined by these four related concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _**Service Level Indicator.**_ A quantitative observation about the behavior of a system\n",

    "## Failures and Failure Tolerance\n",
    "We can define __failure tolerance__ in terms of guaranteeing __safety and liveness properties.__ In the _absence_ of failure, a system always guarantees both its __safety and liveness properties.__ However, in the _presence_ of failure, we may have to compromise.\n",

    "#### Masking failure tolerance\n",
    "If a system guarantees both safety and liveness in the presence of failure, then the system provides __masking failure tolerance.__\n",

    "__Masking failure tolerance__, the most desirable form of failure tolerance, amounts to failure transparency. However, masking failure tolerance may be either too costly to achieve or simply impossible to achieve, forcing us to make choices.\n",

    "#### Non-masking failure tolerance\n",
    "If a system guarantees __liveness__ but does not guarantee __safety__ in the presence of failure, then the system provides __Non-masking failure tolerance.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally speaking, the system makes no guarantee not to make any mistakes, but the system does guarantee to make progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example of a queue that guarantees fully ordered (first in, first out) message delivery in the absence of failure. However, suppose the queue is non-masking failure tolerant. In that case, it will continue delivering messages in the presence of a failure, but messages may be delivered out of order for the duration of the failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fail-safe failure tolerance\n",
    "If a system guarantees __safety__ but does not guarantee __liveness__ in the presence of failure, then the system guarantees __Fail-Safe Failure Tolerance.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally speaking, the system does guarantee not to make any mistakes, but the system does not guarantee to make progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the previous example, if the queue is fail-safe failure tolerant, it will stop delivering messages in the presence of a failure to prevent messages from being delivered out of order for the duration of the failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### None of the above\n",
    "If a system guarantee does not guarantee safety or liveness in the presence of failure, then the system is simply not failure tolerant at all. Arguably in most cases, this is simply not acceptable.\n",
